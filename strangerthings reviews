        ONE OF THE BEST SHOWS I HAVE EVER WATCHED!!! I’m usually not that into Netflix horror shows, but when I saw a bunch of TikTok’s about Stranger things, it immediately turned my attention to watch. The moment I pressed play on my remote on the first episode and watched the first few minutes I became obsessed. Everything in this is just filled with suspense, interesting things, and shocking cliffhangers at the end of every episode. My favorite female character has gotta be Eleven (El) and my favorite male is Jonathan. Although the show has some jump scares in it, it still creates some action packed content for everyone to enjoy. I recommend Stranger things for anyone aged 13 or older, but if you’re really into horror, then maybe 10 or older. If you have not watched this show yet, go do it, and maybe invite some family or friends to watch with you!!!! Remember this series is only on Netflix but a lot of you have it so it shouldn’t be a problem at all. I rate ST a ♾/10 and a 5 star rating.

        Stranger Things is absolutely as good as everyone says it is. When a show is as talked about about as much as this one has been it's hard to live up to expectations. Stranger Things has not only met those expectations but has surpassed them in every way. This is the show that our Netflix on the map as far as original shows go as this was not only one of their first but their biggest. As much as I love this show it's probably time for it for end and it is. This upcoming season is going to be the last. We have literally watched this cast grow up, they were children when this show first started and now they're all in their 20's. I can't wait for this last season and going to miss it when it's gone!

        This show has been amazing since the first season.
I remember when the show first came out. It was scary, eerie and had that unique 80s feeling to it.
The story of this show is unique, and the concept of the upside down is just fascinating...and scary.
I have just watched season 4 and it was nothing short of amazing. The way the characters have grown throughout the show, and the way all the seasons tie in with eachother is truly awesome.
I cannot wait for the final season to come out, and I'm sad that an amazing show like this is coming to an end. Hopefully, there will be opportunities for maybe a mini spin off series or something related to the stranger things universe in the future...but that's just wishful thinking.
