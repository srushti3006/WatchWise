1] as_if_itsanisha:
La La Land" starring Ryan Gosling, 
Emma Stone, John Legend, and many other 
A-listing Actors, is an absolute must watch. 
In addition to showcasing the early life of 
Mia and Sebastian,La La Land perfectly displays 
how in life"The show must go on" and how 
life doesn't always go as planned. La La Land 
uses lighting, colouring and exceptional 
cinematography to tell the stories of Mia and 
Sebastian in their journeys for success.

This is the most heartbreaking movie I have 
ever seen in my life. My heart is shattered
 and I can never hear any of those songs 
again or I will pass away.

It was SO good but the ending was not what I 
expected. The ending was really unexpected I 
feel like it would’ve been better if the ending 
was like how a lot of people would’ve expected it to be. 
It was a cool twist though. The songs are so 
good though like omg. The jazz. It’s amazing 
like omggg. Other then the ending, so good 
literally amazing I would totally watch it again.

This Movie is my personalf favorite. People will 
hate it and say things but only those who have 
loved someone or have ad their first love will 
truly understand this movie and connect with it. 
Which is why this movie is my favorite, I really 
relate to it and learned from the ending that 
sometimes two people can forever love each other 
but they have their own path for the best. I hope 
this movie gets more recognition. The music is 
also absolutely beautiful and catchy. I just 
LOVE THIS MOVIE SO MUCH!!!

The thing with Damien Chazelle is he loves to 
write about music and musicians, but he isn’t one, 
and doesn’t really know the first thing about it. 
It’s weird. It’s just what he imagines being a 
musician must be like. As someone who is a musician, 
I do know what it’s like, so I’m not really 
interested in his imaginings.
